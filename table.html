        Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves /ˈeɪviːz/, characterised by feathers,
        toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a
        strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird
        to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are
        passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known
        groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which evolved from forelimbs, gave birds the
        ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites,
        penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely
        adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have
        further evolved for swimming.

        Birds are a group of feathered theropod dinosaurs, and constitute the only living dinosaurs. Likewise, birds are
        considered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest living relatives are the
        crocodilians. Birds are descendants of the primitive avialans (whose members include Archaeopteryx) which first
        appeared about 160 million years ago (mya) in China. According to DNA evidence, modern birds (Neornithes)
        evolved in the Middle to Late Cretaceous, and diversified dramatically around the time of the
        Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 mya, which killed off the pterosaurs and all non-avian dinosaurs.

        Many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture. Birds are
        social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and songs, and participating in such behaviours as cooperative
        breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially (but
        not necessarily sexually) monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely
        for life. Other species have breeding systems that are polygynous (one male with many females) or, rarely,
        polyandrous (one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through
        sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended
        period of parental care after hatching.

        Many species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in
        manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers.
        Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. Guano (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a
        fertiliser. Birds figure throughout human culture. About 120 to 130 species have become extinct due to human
        activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird
        species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational birdwatching is an important
        part of the ecotourism industry.
